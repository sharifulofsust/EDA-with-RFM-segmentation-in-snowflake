##RFM segmentation is a marketing and customer segmentation technique that classifies customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, frequency of purchase, and monetary value. The acronym "RFM" stands for "Recency," "Frequency," and "Monetary." RFM analysis helps businesses identify and target different customer segments based on these three key metrics. It's widely used in e-commerce, retail, and other industries to understand and engage with customers more effectively.

Typical RFM segments may include:

Champions: High recency, high frequency, and high monetary value.
Loyal Customers: High recency, high frequency, but lower monetary value.
Potential Loyalists: High recency, moderate frequency, and moderate monetary value.
At-Risk Customers: Low recency, high frequency, and high monetary value.
Lost Customers: Low recency, low frequency, and low monetary value.
